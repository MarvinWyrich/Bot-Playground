[![Code smells](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Bot-Playground%3ABot-Playground&metric=code_smells)](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=Bot-Playground%3ABot-Playground&resolved=false&types=CODE_SMELL)

This is the playground for the [Refactoring-Bot](https://github.com/Refactoring-Bot/Refactoring-Bot), which can automatically fix code smells by refactoring.
The preferred way to try the bot is to fork from this repository and let the bot work on the fork.

The project in this repository should contain exactly one example per code smell that the bot can (soon) automatically fix.
